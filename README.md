# Implementation

This project flow has both integration of Frontend and backend too.

## Backend

Install modules.

```bash
npm install
```
Run the backend.
```bash
npm run start
```

The Backend connects to mongodb so you have to create a .env file in project such as
```javascript
MONGOURL =  "mongodb+srv://<YOUR_DB_ID>:<Your_DB_PASS>@cluster0.am5xmqs.mongodb.net/admindb"
PORT = 4500
```

## Frontend
Install modules

```bash
npm install
```

Run the frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```
